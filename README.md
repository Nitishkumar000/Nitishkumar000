👨‍💻 Hello, fellow innovators! I'm Nitish Kumar, a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, and a passion for building secure, scalable, and intelligent systems.

🧠 My expertise in AI/ML spans Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs), where I’ve worked with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and vector databases like Pinecone & Milvus to create context-aware AI agents, chatbots, and recommendation systems. I’ve developed fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific tasks, automated workflows with AI-powered RAG pipelines, and built autonomous decision-making AI agents.

🔐 In Cybersecurity, I focus on secure AI model deployment, encryption, ethical hacking, adversarial defense techniques, and designing AI pipelines with security-first principles—ensuring trustworthy and tamper-resistant AI systems.

💻 On the development side, I’m skilled in Java backend development using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and REST APIs, building microservices-based architectures that integrate with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. My backend work often powers AI-driven applications, enabling seamless data handling and real-time AI inference.

🐍 With Python, I’ve created projects like:

    AI-powered Document Summarizer using LangChain + OpenAI + Pinecone

    Cybersecurity Threat Detection System using Scikit-learn & anomaly detection models

    Real-time Object Detection System with YOLOv8 + OpenCV

    Automated Resume Screening Tool with NLP & LLM integration

    AI-powered News Sentiment Analyzer with Hugging Face Transformers

☕ With Java, I’ve built:

    E-commerce Backend System (Spring Boot + Hibernate + MySQL)

    AI-assisted Student Management Portal integrating chatbot features

    Secure Banking API System with JWT authentication and audit logging

🌐 In Web & Android development, I have delivered:

    AI-driven Personal Finance Tracker (React + Flask backend + OpenAI)

    Android App with AI-based Plagiarism Checker

    Portfolio Website with AI-powered chatbot for interactive engagement

🚀 I thrive on end-to-end solution development—from AI research & model building to secure deployment & backend integration—and I’m passionate about collaborating on projects that push the limits of what AI can achieve in real-world scenarios.

Let’s connect to co-create the next generation of intelligent, secure, and impactful systems! 🌟🤖💡
