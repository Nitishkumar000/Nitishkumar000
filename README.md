👨‍💻 Hello, fellow innovators!
I’m Nitish Kumar, a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I’m deeply passionate about building intelligent, secure, and data-driven systems that bring ideas to life — systems that don’t just process data, but truly understand it to solve real-world problems with innovation and precision.

🧠 Over the years, I’ve developed expertise across Generative AI, Agentic AI, Data Science, Data Analytics, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I love working at the intersection of research and real-world application — turning AI concepts into working, impactful solutions.

I’ve gained hands-on experience with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and vector databases like Pinecone and Milvus. These tools have helped me create context-aware AI agents, fine-tuned LLMs, and automation pipelines capable of learning, reasoning, and adapting intelligently.

📊 In the world of Data Science and Analytics, I enjoy uncovering the story hidden within data. From data preprocessing and feature engineering to data visualization and model evaluation, I’ve worked extensively with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tableau, and Power BI.

One of my favorite projects is the Sales Analytics Dashboard for McDonald’s 🍟, where I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualized regional sales trends, highlighted best-performing products, and revealed customer behavior insights. This project showed me how powerful data can be when transformed into business intelligence — turning raw numbers into real strategies.

I’ve also worked on analytics projects focused on customer behavior analysis, financial forecasting, and business performance optimization, helping transform data into action and insight.

🤖 I take pride in designing end-to-end AI and Data Science pipelines — from data collection and cleaning to model training, optimization, and deployment. I’m fascinated by multimodal AI, reinforcement learning, and explainable AI, and I’m constantly exploring how to make machine learning models not just accurate, but understandable and ethical.

🧩 Some of my key AI & Data Science projects include:
📊 Sales Analytics Dashboard (McDonald’s): Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales performance, identify top-selling products, and provide data-driven insights for business strategy.
❤️ CardioAI – Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System: Designed a hybrid ML + Deep Learning model combining ANN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to predict heart disease with ~90% accuracy and explainability using SHAP.
💬 AI-Powered Healthcare Chatbot: Built an NLP-driven healthcare assistant using TensorFlow and SpaCy that provides personalized health recommendations.
🐱 Cats vs Dogs Image Classification (CNN): Developed a deep learning computer vision model using TensorFlow and data augmentation for accurate image classification.
📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Networks: Created predictive models using Keras and financial APIs to analyze market trends and forecast stock performance.

📑 Research Publication:
🧬 CardioAI: An Intelligent Machine Learning Approach for Heart Disease Prediction
My final-year B.Tech research paper introduced a machine learning and deep learning framework that combines multiple algorithms — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks — for precise heart disease risk prediction.
The model achieved nearly 90% accuracy, incorporated SHAP-based explainability, and emphasized trustworthy, transparent AI for healthcare. This project strengthened my belief that AI isn’t just about accuracy — it’s about understanding, ethics, and trust.
