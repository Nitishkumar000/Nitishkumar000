👨‍💻 Hello, fellow innovators! I'm Nitish Kumar, a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science Engineering specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science, passionate about creating intelligent, secure, and data-driven systems that solve real-world problems with innovation and precision.

🧠 My expertise spans Generative AI, Agentic AI, Data Science, Data Analytics, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I have hands-on experience with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and vector databases like Pinecone and Milvus, enabling me to build context-aware AI agents, fine-tuned LLMs, and AI-powered automation pipelines.

📊 In the field of Data Science & Analytics, I excel at data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization using tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tableau, and Power BI. I’ve developed interactive dashboards and analytical models that uncover insights and support data-driven decision-making.
One of my notable works includes creating a Sales Analytics Dashboard for McDonald’s, which visualized regional performance trends, identified top-selling items, and provided actionable business insights. I’ve also worked on analytics projects focusing on customer behavior, financial forecasting, and performance optimization.

🤖 I specialize in designing end-to-end AI and data pipelines—from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and real-time analytics integration. My focus areas include model optimization, interpretability, multimodal AI, and reinforcement learning, ensuring every system is intelligent, explainable, and adaptive.

🧩 Some of my key AI & Data Science projects include:

Sales Analytics Dashboard (McDonald’s): Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales performance, identify top-selling items, analyze customer trends, and enable data-driven business strategies.

CardioAI – Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System: Developed a hybrid ML + Deep Learning model (ANN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) achieving 90% accuracy and enhanced interpretability with SHAP.

AI-Powered Healthcare Chatbot: Built an NLP-based chatbot that provides personalized healthcare insights using TensorFlow and SpaCy.

Cats vs Dogs Image Classification (CNN): Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and data augmentation for accurate image recognition.
